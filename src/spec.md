# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the dashboard sidebar visibility issue so it appears properly on the left side of the screen.

**Planned changes:**
- Investigate and fix CSS properties that may be hiding the sidebar (display, visibility, opacity, z-index, overflow)
- Ensure sidebar positioning and width are correctly applied
- Verify responsive behavior doesn't inadvertently hide the sidebar at current viewport size
- Confirm Deep Onyx background and Emerald accent colors are properly rendered

**User-visible outcome:** The sidebar with navigation links (Command Center, Security Vault, Team, Pricing, Settings), user identity section, and logout button is visible on the left side of the dashboard with proper styling.
