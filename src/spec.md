# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the pricing table displaying Basic and Premium plans from the CommandCenter dashboard.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the PricingTable component from the CommandCenter dashboard page
- Adjust dashboard layout to accommodate the removal of the pricing section

**User-visible outcome:** The CommandCenter dashboard no longer displays the Basic ($299/month) and Premium ($499/month) pricing plans, providing a cleaner view focused on operational metrics and controls.
