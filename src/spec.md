## Summary
**Goal:** Redesign the CommandCenter dashboard to match the layout, visual style, and component structure of the reference application.

**Planned changes:**
- Transform CommandCenter page layout to match reference application's grid structure and card arrangements
- Update color scheme, card backgrounds, text colors, and accent colors to match reference aesthetic
- Redesign dashboard cards (KPIMetricsRow, NeuralIngestInput, SynopsisEngineCard, SpectralAnalysisCard) to match reference content structure and presentation
- Update DashboardLayout sidebar navigation structure, icons, and styling to match reference
- Adjust responsive behavior and mobile layout to align with reference application's breakpoints

**User-visible outcome:** The dashboard will have a completely redesigned visual appearance matching the reference application, with updated layout, colors, card designs, and navigation while maintaining all existing functionality.
