# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove pricing from the landing page and add a new Subscriptions page in the dashboard with two pricing tiers (₹300/month Basic and ₹500/month Premium).

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the existing 3-tier pricing section from the landing page
- Create a new Subscriptions page accessible from the dashboard sidebar (positioned after Analytics & Vault)
- Display two subscription tiers: Basic (₹300/month) and Premium (₹500/month) as glassmorphism cards
- Differentiate features between tiers: Basic includes essential meeting intelligence features (up to 10 recordings/month), Premium adds advanced security and tactical features (unlimited recordings, priority support)
- Add Subscribe CTA buttons that show a toast notification indicating simulated subscription flow

**User-visible outcome:** Users will no longer see pricing on the landing page. Authenticated users can navigate to a new Subscriptions page from the dashboard sidebar to view and select between Basic and Premium subscription tiers with clearly differentiated features.
