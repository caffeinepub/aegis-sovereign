  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to DashboardLayout.tsx that implement sidebar visibility fixes with proper Deep Onyx background (#050505) and Emerald accents (#10b981), navigation links, user identity display, and logout button. All three requirements (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3) appear to be addressed in the implementation.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly states as non-goal: 'Changing the sidebar position from left to another location' and 'Adding new navigation items or features to the sidebar'. The Sheet/SheetTrigger implementation adds a mobile hamburger menu feature that was not requested and may conflict with the constraint to 'Preserve existing navigation structure'.",
