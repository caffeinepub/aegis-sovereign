  "summary": "The diff implements most of the BuildRequest requirements including store initialization guards, homepage-as-default entry point, login button binding, localStorage persistence, authentication-gated dashboard rendering, and re-injection of Asset Shield and Live Spectral Analysis components. However, REQ-8 regarding dark theme preservation appears violated, as AssetShieldCard uses white/light styling instead of the requested dark glassmorphic theme.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "AssetShieldCard uses light theme styling with white background instead of dark glassmorphic theme",
      "reason": "REQ-8 explicitly requires maintaining 'high-end dark theme with glassmorphic UI styling' and preserving 'scanlines, gradients, and tactical aesthetics'. AssetShieldCard.tsx shows 'bg-white border-[#10b981]/20' and 'text-gray-900' instead of dark theme colors. The card also lacks backdrop blur, glassmorphic transparency, and tactical aesthetics requested.",
