  "summary": "The implementation successfully covers all 13 requirements (REQ-108 through REQ-120) for the localStorage-based authentication system. A new utility file handles user registration and authentication, LoginPage.tsx was rewritten with toggle-based forms using CSS transitions instead of Framer Motion, ProtectedRoute.tsx validates localStorage sessions, and DashboardLayout.tsx displays personalized greetings. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
